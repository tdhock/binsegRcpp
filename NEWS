TODOS

2021.1.6

More comments in binseg_normal.cpp to help potential GSOC students.

2020.10.7

Comment binseg_normal.cpp to explain optimal_cost computation.

Use C++ multiset with operator< instead of multimap/vector.

Use cumsum C++ vector for constant time mean/cost computation for any
split.

Store cost of segments before/after split, pass the cost values to
maybe_add to avoid having to recompute them.

Computation works for only one data point.
